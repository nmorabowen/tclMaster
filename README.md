# TCL Master

**TCL Master** is a Python library designed to programmatically manage, parse, and modify Tcl input files generated by STKO (Scientific ToolKit for OpenSees). 

It uses the **Composition Pattern** to separate file system logic, Tcl parsing, and data injection, allowing for robust "Preprocessing" of simulation files before execution.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Central `tclMaster` class manages the model state.
- **Robust File Handling**: Recursively finds `.mpco`, `.tcl`, and partition files.
- **Tcl Preprocessing**:
  - Inject lines into Tcl files based on Regex context (e.g., "Insert after Node Definitions").
  - Replace variable values (`set var value`) safely.
  - Comment out blocks of code.
  - **Path Corrections**: Safely replace hardcoded file paths (handling `/` and `.` characters).

## Installation

Run this command in the root folder (where `pyproject.toml` is):

```bash
pip install .
# OR for editable mode (allows you to change code without reinstalling)
pip install -e .
